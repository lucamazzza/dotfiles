#=====================================#
#          1. INTERFACE               #
#=====================================#

# Show hidden files (i.e. files starting with a dot).
;ShowHiddenFiles=false

# Files listed in a '.hidden' file in the current directory will be hidden
# whenever hidden files are not shown (i.e. ShowHiddenFiles is set to false).
# Both plain file names and wildcards are supported.
;ReadDotHidden=false

# Use a regular expression to filter files from the files list.
# Example: "!.*~$" to exclude backup files (ending with ~), or "^\." to
# list only hidden files. File type filters are also supported. Example:
# "=d" to list directories only, or "!=l" to exclude symlinks.
# Run 'help file-filters' for more information.
;Filter=""

# List directories first.
;ListDirsFirst=true

# The amount of files contained by a directory is informed next
# to the directory name. However, this feature might slow things down
# when, for example, listing files on a remote server. The files counter
# can be disabled here, via the --no-files-counter option, or using the
# 'fc' command while in the program itself.
# Note: Classify (see below) must be set to true.
;FilesCounter=true

# If running with colors, append directory indicator to directories. If
# running without colors (via the --no-color option), append file type
# indicator at the end of file names:
# '/' for directories
# '@' for symbolic links
# '=' for sockets
# '|' for FIFO/pipes
# '*' for for executable files
# '+' for block special files
# '-' for character special files
# '?' for unknown file types
# Bear in mind that when running in light mode the check for executable
# files won't be performed, and thereby no indicator will be added to
# executable files.
# Note: Setting this option to false disables the files counter.
;Classify=true

# Symbolic links are colored as the target file name. An indicator character
# (by default '@') is placed at the beginning of the name to mark it as a
# symbolic link.
# The color of this indicator can be customized via the 'lc' code in the
# color scheme file (InterfaceColors field).
;ColorLinksAsTarget=false

# Mas, the files list pager. Possible values are:
# 0/false: Disable the pager.
# 1/true: Run the pager whenever the list of files does not fit on the screen.
# >1: Run the pager whenever the amount of files in the current directory is
# greater than or equal to this value (say, 1000).
;Pager=false

# How to list files in the pager. Possible values:
# auto: use the current listing mode
# long: list files in long view
# short: list files in short view
;PagerView=auto

# How to list files: 0 = vertically (like ls(1) would), 1 = horizontally.
;ListingMode=0

# How to sort listed files.
# Available options: none, name, version, extension, blocks, size, links,
# atime, btime, ctime, mtime, inode, owner, and group.
;Sort=version

# By default, files are sorted from less to more (ex: from 'a' to 'z' if
# using the "name" method). To invert this ordering, set SortReverse to
# true (you can also use the --sort-reverse option or the 'st rev' command).
;SortReverse=false

# Display extended file metadata next to file names (long listing format).
;LongViewMode=false

# Properties fields to be displayed for each file name in long view mode:
# f = files counter (for directories)
# B = file allocated blocks
# d = inode number
# l = number of hard links
# p|n = permissions: either symbolic (p) or numeric/octal (n)
# i|I = user/group IDs: either as number (i) or name (I)
# G = if i|I is set, don't print groups
# a|b|m|c = last (a)ccess, (b)irth, (m)odification, or status (c)hange time
# s|S = size (either human readable (s) or bytes (S))
# x = extended attributes/capabilities/ACLs (marked as '@') (requires p|n)
# A single dash ("-") disables all fields
#
# Note that, exception made of 'x' and 'G', fields will be displayed in the
# order specified here.
#
# Example: display only permissions (numeric) and size (human readable):
#PropFields="ns"
# or, to display file permissions, modification time, and size (in bytes):
#PropFields="pmS"
;PropFields="xfpIsm"

# Number of spaces between fields in long view. Possible values: 1-2.
;PropFieldsGap=1

# Style used to print timestamps in long view mode.
# Available styles: default, relative, iso, long-iso, full-iso, +FORMAT
# FORMAT is interpreted like in strftime(3).

# for older files.
# Examples:
;TimeStyle="full-iso"
;TimeStyle="relative"
;TimeStyle="+%F %T"

# If sorting files by time, use the same time files are sorted by for the time
# field in long view (disregarding the value set in PropFields).
;TimeFollowsSort=true

# Append an 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'm' to the timestamp (long view only) to indicate
# the kind of timestamp, i.e, access, birth, status change, or modification
# time respectively. In case of relative times, uppercase characters are used
# instead for better visibility.
;TimestampMark=false

# Same as TimeStyle, but for the 'p/pp' command.
# Available styles: default, iso, long-iso, full-iso, full-iso-nano, +FORMAT
# Nano-second precision is available via the %N modifier.
;PTimeStyle="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z"

# If running in long view, print directories full size (i.e. recursively).
;FullDirSize=false

# Print files apparent size instead of actual device usage.
;ApparentSize=true

# In light mode, extra file type checks (except those provided by
# the d_type field of the dirent structure (see readdir(3))
# are disabled to speed up the listing process. stat(3) and access(3)
# are not executed at all, so that we cannot know in advance if a file
# is readable by the current user, if it is executable, SUID, SGID, if a
# symlink is broken, and so on. The file extension check is ignored as
# well, so that the color per extension feature is disabled.
;LightMode=false

# Clear the screen before listing files.
# Possible values: 'true', 'false', 'internal' (restrict this behavior to
# internal commands only: shell commands won't clear the screen).
# Note: if set to 'internal', the current list of files won't be refreshed
# even if an external command creates, removes, or renames a file in the
# current directory.
;ClearScreen=true

# Maximum file name length for listed files. If TrimNames is set to true,
# names larger than MaxFilenameLen will be truncated at MaxFilenameLen
# using a tilde (~).
# Set it to -1 (or empty) to remove this limit.
# If running in long mode, this setting is overriden by MinFilenameTrim
# whenever MaxFilenameLen is smaller than MinFilenameTrim.
;MaxFilenameLen=20

# Trim file names longer than MaxFilenameLen.
;TrimNames=true

# Minimum length at which a file name can be trimmed in long view mode.
# When running in long mode, this setting overrides MaxFilenameLen

;MinFilenameTrim=20

# A comma separated list of workspace names in the form NUM=NAME.
# Example: "1=MAIN,2=EXTRA,3=GIT" or "1=α,2=β,3=γ"
;WorkspaceNames=""

# If set to true, settings changed in the current workspace (only via
# the command line or keyboard shortcuts) are kept private to that
# workspace and made persistent (for the current session only), even
# when switching workspaces.
;PrivateWorkspaceSettings=false

# Print the disk usage of the file system the current directory belongs to
# in the form "FREE/TOTAL (FREE_PERCENTAGE) FS_TYPE DEV_NAME".
;DiskUsage=false

# Print a map of the current position in the directory history list,
# showing previous, current, and next entries.
;DirhistMap=false

# Print the list of selected files after the files list. Since this
# list could become quite extensive, you can limit the number of printed 
# entries using the MaxPrintSelfiles option below.
;PrintSelfiles=false

# Maximum amount of selected files to be printed if PrinSelFiles is set
# to true. Possible values: -1 = no limit, 0 = auto (never print more
# than half terminal height), or any positive value.
;MaxPrintSelfiles=0

# Color schemes (or just themes) are stored in the colors directory
# ($XDG_DATA_DIRS/clifm/colors, usually /usr/local/share/clifm/colors
# or /usr/share/clifm/colors). You can place your custom themes in
# $HOME/.config/clifm/colors.
#
# Use the 'cs' command or the '--color-scheme' command line option to set
# a theme.
#
# Run 'cs edit' to edit the current theme.
#
# Each theme includes color definitions, just as definitions for the
# prompt, the warning prompt, the dividing line, and the FZF window.
#
# Use TAB to list available themes: 'cs TAB'.
#
# Visit https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm-colors to get a few extra themes.
#
# Defaults to 'default-256', or 'default' (16 colors) if 256 colors support
# is not detected.
;ColorScheme=

# Enable/disable icons.
# By default, emojis (widely available today) are used as icons.
